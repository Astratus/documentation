There are several services provided for the development of Asterisk.

* [Issue Tracking](/Asterisk-Issue-Guidelines)
* [Wiki](/Home)
* [Code Contribution - Version Control](/Code-Contribution)
* [Source Browsing](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk)
* [Mailing Lists](/Mailing-Lists)

There is a regular maintenance window every Monday from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM Central Time, during which services may have intermittent availability while we apply patches, upgrades, etc. If maintenance is required outside of this window, notice will be sent to the [asterisk-announce](http://lists.digium.com/mailman/listinfo/asterisk-announce) mailing list. If any of the community services are unavailable outside of a scheduled maintenance time, please notifyÂ [the Asterisk development team.](mailto:asteriskteam@digium.com?subject=Community-Service-Interruption)
