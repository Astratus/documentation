The [asterisk.org](https://asterisk.org) community services use a centralized authentication system to manage user accounts. This means that the account that you use to log into [issues.asterisk.org](https://issues.asterisk.org) is the same account you can use to access [wiki.asterisk.org](https://wiki.asterisk.org).


To create an asterisk.org account, visit [signup.asterisk.org](https://signup.asterisk.org) and fill out the form.


The community services that currently support this centralized authentication are:


* [issues.asterisk.org](https://issues.asterisk.org)
* [wiki.asterisk.org](https://wiki.asterisk.org)
* [code.asterisk.org](https://code.asterisk.org)


Over time, accounts on our other community services will be moved to the same centralized authentication system.
