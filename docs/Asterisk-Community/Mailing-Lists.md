### Community Forums

For end-user support and commercial postings the [community forums](https://community.asterisk.org/) should be used.

### Development Mailing List

A [development mailing list](https://groups.io/g/asterisk-dev) is present for discussion regarding the development of Asterisk itself.

### Read-Only Mailing Lists

The Asterisk project previously maintained an independent mailing list server for many different purposes. This has been decommissioned and archived, with the community forums and new development mailing list taking their place. Links to the old mailing lists remain below in case archive access is required.
