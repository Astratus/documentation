Adding voicemail to the extensions is quite simple. The [Asterisk voicemail module](/Voicemail) provides two key applications for dealing with voice mail. The first, named **[VoiceMail()](/Asterisk-13-Application_VoiceMail)**, allows a caller to leave a voice mail message in the specified mailbox. The second, called **[VoiceMailMain()](/Asterisk-13-Application_VoiceMailMain)**, allows the mailbox owner to retrieve their messages and change their greetings.
