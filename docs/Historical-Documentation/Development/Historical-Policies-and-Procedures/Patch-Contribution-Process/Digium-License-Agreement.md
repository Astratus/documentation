Signing the Digium License Agreement
====================================

If you are going to contribute code to the Asterisk project, you will need to electronically sign the [Digium Open Source Software Project Submission Agreement](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/issues/jira/secure/DigiumLicense.jspa). To do so, click the button **Sign a License Agreement** upon logging in to the [Asterisk issue tracker](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/issues/jira).

The issue tracker keeps a record of contributions and the license agreements that were in effect when those contributions were uploaded. Code contributions cannot be attached without first marking them as a contribution under the license agreement, and code contributions that are not marked as such will be removed from the issue tracker.

Attaching a code contribution
-----------------------------

* When using the "Attach Files" form on a particular issue, be sure to select the "Yes, this is a code or documentation contribution" radio button.
	+ If you don't have a user license agreement, you'll see the message:  
	 "You dont appear to have a current, signed submission license agreement on file. Please sign one before attempting to upload a code or documentation contribution."
	+ To sign a submission license agreement, click the **Sign a License Agreement** button in the top navigation bar in JIRA.
* The license agreement will be reviewed by Digium's legal department, then you'll be notified by E-mail of acceptance or rejection. If accepted, you will now be able to attach the patch. A license associated to your account will be viewable with the patch.

Multiple Authors of a Single Patch
----------------------------------

* If you are the sole author of your patch, read and sign the [Digium Open Source Software Project Submission Agreement](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/issues/jira/secure/DigiumLicense.jspa), then submit your patch.
* If there are multiple authors, all part of a single organization or corporate entity, then the representative of that entity, with that entity's permission, may sign the agreement and submit the patch.
* If the patch has multiple authors, not part of a single organization or corporate entity, then all authors must sign the agreement and then either submit the patch or comment on the issue stating that they also provide and acknowledge the submission.
